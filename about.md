This research was commissioned by the Adult Acute and Urgent Care Management team  Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust to inform local interventions to reduce delayed discharges of adult psychiatric admissions.

Aims
The research was conducted in two study phases to seek answers on:
•	How many adult delayed transfers of care have occurred in the Trust between 2016-2021?
•	How many patients have spent more than 56 days in hospital (locally defined delayed discharge/national average: 51 days)?
•	What do key staff who engage in discharge decisions think the barriers and facilitators are for earlier discharge based on past learning experiences of delays?
•	Which patient, clinical and service level factors (internal/external) influence LOS in our adult inpatient units?

Methods
We completed:
•	A thematic analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews with in-patient staff, focusing on learning experiences of barriers and facilitators to early discharge;

•	A statistical risk prediction model to identify significant factors that influence LOS, potential delays and readmissions. Estimates are based on data from 5351 admissions in the OHFTs seven adult in-patient units (2015-2021).
