# Length of inpatient stays in adult acute care

## Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust

Predicting hospital demand entails estimating a patient's length of stay (LOS) and the probability that a patient will require longer-term admission and more resources (beds, staff, equipment). Estimating LOS is challenging as it requires investigating patients' trajectories whilst accounting for complexities in the data.

### How long will a patient stay in hospital? - A graphical risk prediction model
We estimated the probability of LOS for different patient and service characteristics whilst adjusting for differences between wards, ages and gender.
The graph estimates patients probability of staying in hospital over time by type of mental health problem with the option to add risk factors.
*More features will be added soon.*

For example, how many weeks will a patient with psychosis who is homeless stay? *Answer: Almost 1/5 of admissions will stay over a year in hospital*

Use the graph to:
* Compare the length of stay for different risk groups
* Check which patients are likely to stay for a longer period
* Focus on specific time periods using the drop down menu labelled "All".

## Average lengths of stays*

 | Primary diagnosis | Average in days (95% CI) | 
 | --- | --- | 
 | **Bipolar disorders** | 93.4 (74.2-112.7) | 
 | **Learning/Intellectual disability** | 86.0 (32.7-139.2) | 
 | **Psychosis** | 77.2 (71.9-82.5) | 
 | **Dementia** | 65.2 (6.8-123.5) | 
 | **Anxiety disorders** | 55.7 (34.4-76.9) | 
 | **Any comorbid substance misuse** | 46.7 (40.0-53.4) | 
 | **Neurodevelopmental disorder** | 43.0 (19.4-66.6) | 
 | **Eating disorders** | 40.3 (-5, 85.7) | 
 | **Depressive episode** | 31.3 (21.5-41.1) | 
 | **Mental health problem NOS** | 20.5 (-4.6, 45.6) | 
 | **Personality disorder** | 20.0 (10.6-29.3) | 
 | **Drug misuse (primary admission cause)** | 19.5 (4.2-34.8) | 
 | **Trauma- and stressor-related disorders** | 14.4 (-0.8, 29.6) | 

*Adjusted for age, sex, admission year, and ward of discharge
