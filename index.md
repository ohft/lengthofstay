# Length of inpatient stays in adult acute care

## Introduction
Longer hospital stays can have profound effects on patients’ health and development. Over the past 40 years, there has been a significant reduction of inpatient mental health beds, with increasing pressure on services to reduce lengths of stay (LOS). Whilst there has been consensus on this approach, reducing LOS has not always been successful. Reports reveal that no significant reduction of LOS for psychiatric admissions have happened in the NHS over the past 15 years. This could be due to the current occupancy levels and LOS being optimal, or due to systemic problems preventing further progress. The extent to which clinical and service factors can impact LOS is also not well understood.


This research was commissioned by the Mental Health Urgent Care and Social Care Team at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust to inform local interventions to reduce delayed discharges of adult psychiatric admissions.

## Aims
The research was conducted in two study phases to seek answers on: 
•	What do clinicians and social workers think about delayed discharges (e.g. do we have a problem)?

•	What do staff think are the barriers and facilitators to preventing delayed discharges?

•	How many delayed transfers of care in the Trust are adult acute admissions (2016-2021)?

•	How many patients have spent more than 56 days in hospital (locally defined “delayed discharge”/national average: 51 days)?

•	Which patient, clinical and service level factors influence LOS in OHFT’s adult inpatient units?

## Methods
We completed:
•	A thematic analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews with in-patient/community staff (Oxfordshire & Buckinghamshire), focusing on learning experiences of barriers and facilitators to early discharge.

•	A statistical risk prediction model to identify significant factors that influence LOS, potential delays and readmissions. Estimates are based on 5351 admissions in the OHFTs seven adult acute in-patient units (2015-2021).

## Key findings - How long will a patient stay in hospital and why? 
------------------------------------------
The summaries below contain key findings and corresponding recommendations.
A graphical risk calculator is also available in the graph below.

<span style="color:red">This site is under development and accompanies the manuscript *"Risk prediction model of length of stays, delayed discharges and readmissions in adult psychiatric inpatient units in England: a mixed methods study"* pending submission for journal peer-review. **The content should not be used until the final article has been published. The information is not intended for clinical use.** </span>

**A graphical risk prediction model:** 
We estimated the probability of LOS for different patient and service characteristics whilst adjusting for differences between wards, ages and gender.
The graph estimates patients probability of staying in hospital over time by type of mental health problem with the option to add risk factors.
*More features will be added soon.*

For example, how many weeks will a patient with psychosis who is homeless stay? *Answer: Almost 1/5 of admissions will stay over a year in hospital*

Use the graph to:
* Compare the length of stay for different risk groups
* Check which patients are likely to stay for a longer period
* Focus on specific time periods using the drop down menu labelled "All".
