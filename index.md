# Length of inpatient stays in adult acute care

Predicting hospital demand entails estimating a patient's length of stay (LOS) and the probability that a patient will require longer-term admission and more resources (beds, staff, equipment). Estimating LOS is challenging as it requires investigating patients' trajectories whilst accounting for complexities in the data.

<span style="color:red">This site is under development and accompanies the manuscript *"Risk prediction model of length of stays, delayed discharges and readmissions in adult psychiatric inpatient units in England: a mixed methods study"* pending submission for journal peer-review. **The content should not be used until the final article has been published. The information is not intended for clinical use.** </span>

## How long will a patient stay in hospital? 
------------------------------------------

**A graphical risk prediction model:** 
We estimated the probability of LOS for different patient and service characteristics whilst adjusting for differences between wards, ages and gender.
The graph estimates patients probability of staying in hospital over time by type of mental health problem with the option to add risk factors.
*More features will be added soon.*

For example, how many weeks will a patient with psychosis who is homeless stay? *Answer: Almost 1/5 of admissions will stay over a year in hospital*

Use the graph to:
* Compare the length of stay for different risk groups
* Check which patients are likely to stay for a longer period
* Focus on specific time periods using the drop down menu labelled "All".

*Adjusted for age, sex, admission year, and ward of discharge
