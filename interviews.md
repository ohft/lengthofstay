# Barriers
----------------------

 | Lack of resources & Teamwork and liaison between roles and services |
 | --- |
 | **Staffing needs and quality of care (agency staff/competent staff)** *“…I mean writing a protocol, a “red2green” schedule, doing the reviews, or building an entire system - that’s all right. But, if you haven’t got enough staff with the skill set to deliver it, then no matter how good I am operationalising it, the rest of it is just never going to work....”* — Consultant 1 *“They say “Oh, get the care coordinator to do it”. The care-coordinator don't have the skills nor the knowledge of the system to say... It's a highly specialist role and unless somebody is delivering on that, then you get amateurs doing it slowly and badly..."* —Consultant 4 |
 | **Lack of continuity of care** *“…for instance.. it's about us having locum CPN's who rotate often they cannot develop a relationship with patients.. I have a patient now who lost their second care coordinator, which is probably one of the factors that led to their collapse.”* —Consultant 8 |
 | **Wards missing designated social worker coordinating transfers** *"We went through a year without a social worker, which is just awful, with people cross covering. But we've now got a ward social worker who works really hard…”* —Participant 2 *“I think also, social workers who are usually involved in this task. They have a very big caseload. Sometimes we don't have social workers. At the moment we don't have one. And we haven’t for a while..”* — Consultant 5 | 
 | **Lack of placements, housing, declined referrals (rehab, placement, accommodation)** *“You get a string of declined referrals from rehab units or specialist accommodations etc. Which are… you know, third party. But we can't find anywhere to take the patients, so we have to keep them...”* —Consultant 2 *“That’s parts of the issue... where they're referred to commissioned housing and turned away because they're saying they "can't meet their needs, because they’re too complex"* —Social worker 4 | 
 | **Delayed or inadequate community treatment** *“You have the option of using the crisis resolution and home treatment services as “a bridge”, which is occasionally clinically a good solution, but often a very poor solution, because this is a short-term team, with changing staff, no overall care plan or resources...”* —Consultant 2 
 | **Need placement database or better brokerage systems** *“When the local response has been inappropriate... literally, the social workers will just have to Google it to find those Rehab places and making referrals… just from what they find on the internet.”* — Consultant 2 
 | **Social worker demands & assessment backlogs** *“…any delay in the last six months, it's largely been waiting for better lives assessments… being processed, and then funding agreed for either supported living or a care package. I think the social workers are quite overloaded with all these assessments...”* —Consultant 4 
 | **Monitoring & screening into the void without outcomes** *“I think our DTOCs patients have been stuck on the ward, with full knowledge of everyone involved, and no amounts of monitoring that… will solve the problem.. You don't really need stopwatch on that, as long as you have some active MDT monitoring, weekly or fortnightly meeting where you talk about how close people are to step down towards discharging, then that’s fine. It’s a problem of doing something about them…without having 20 meetings to talk about that you don’t know where they are going to be put….”* —Consultant 2 | 

 | Treatment and discharge planning |
 | --- |
 | **Shared anxiety between community and wards “not safe to discharge”** *“Because sometimes the people that get delayed get unrecognisably better while they wait. So, I'm a little bit... my line of “do they need to be in hospital or not?” I feel morally must be determined by "Well, what else is there for them?”* … —consultant 6 *“…lots of anxiety around discharge because of either escalation of violence or drug use, or whatever else it might be. It's also the issue of people being held because being refused housing as well, that's another big one.  the community team and its consultant, but also the ward did share that anxiety.* — Social worker 2 *“….I suppose if you've got nervous community workers, and they feel that this person is not ready for discharge, and thinking it's going to increase my caseload more, and worried how we can manage it in the community..”* — Social worker 3
 | **Overloaded, lack of responsibility	Nobody wants to assess capacity.** *"So, it gets bounced about…we have arguments to and from who's going to do this capacity assessment. It delays it being done, then eventually it's done. But it could take up to 4-5 weeks sometimes... as we sometimes think when the case is complex a clinician should be doing it, because we're going to stand up in the court protection...”* — Social worker 5
 | **Miscommunication**	*“….That’s a really hard one. Because it's, it's not great. It's not great. We do have these joint emails. But like I say that has failed….”* — Social worker 5
 | **Easier access of information**	*“So the chap over here, has about 1032 documents on his care notes!? And they’ve lived most of their life in other people's hospitals elsewhere in England, and as many of them have. So I think there's something about accessing the information we need to make swift decisions, that's about carenotes, and it's about an absence of pharmacist input…”*  | 

 | Perceptions and attitudes |
 | --- |
 | **Split between clinical and social work** *“…there's a real conflict for us social workers working within a medical model, we could argue in lots of cases that the Mental Health Act is being used inappropriately to address people's social issues, as opposed to the mental health diagnosis....”* —Social worker 5 *“what I'm saying is the clinical staff on the unit is in agreement. And the cases where there's been a debate …it's been with the social work side of the trust. I’m not even sure sometimes if they should step in, but they do, we can be put under massive pressure. We already know we need to get people out.”* —Consultant 6 *“Interestingly, people very rarely mark people as "Red" they very rarely consider somebody doesn't need to be in hospital, no matter how long their length of stay. The “barriers” column became a bit of a “social work to do list”. So it was interesting that the barrier never really sat with the rest of the clinical team… it became very much this is what the social workers need to do….”* —Participant 3 
 | **“Siloed thinking” – lack of understanding Fluidity blocked – knock on effects	“....a need for greater understanding, not this siloed thinking.** *"So if you delay taking on this patient, who could be referred to your service, and you're doing it to protect your service, rather than fitting it in with an overall greater organisational need …you know, we're all NHS employees. And you should be working for the greater good, whereas some people seem to still think it's their five to fiefdom to do this… Now in some of these cases fluidity gets blocked. You have to go for a hike is power game, you have to be able to say, “if you don't do this”, “I don't do this…”* —Consultant 3 
 | **Feeling, powerless and hopeless - exhausted all options** *“...you can feel relatively powerless as a consultant in all of this.. because if you've got a patient that needs secure supported accommodation. And you know…I don't have a long list of those places, nor is it my job to find one. What am I going to do about it? And social workers tell me that they have exhausted a list of all options. Well… what do I do about that?”* —Consultant 2 *“…working on cases, you encountered the barriers, but you don't really have time or the power to do much about it, apart from thinking about how you might work differently on a case next time to see whether you can circumvent some barriers…”* —Social worker 4 | 
 
 | Patient characteristics |
 | --- |
 | **Deprivation, housing, lack of family support, language barriers** *“…people are better treated at home with their own people. A lot of my patients have no family, no friends, or an elderly parent that can't begin to do it, or a sister somewhere… you could have somebody at home that's quite ill, if there is day-care and if they can access the psychotherapy and somewhere for them to go... Because for some of my patients, they’re so lonely and they’re left alone literally with the voices.”* —Consultant 6 
 | **Psychosis + drug use**	*“The most common ones, I think, are the chronically psychotic patient who can't be placed anywhere because of their risk”* —Consultant 1 *“And then there are people on the other end of that spectrum, who may or may not have a psychotic illness, or probably have had, but have a bit of poly substance misuse thrown in and criminality, and they have lost all of their housing rights. And then they’re trying to get anyone to agree housing is near end of impossible.”*—Consultant 2 
 | **Patients de-skilled, dependency, “revolving door”, personality disorder** *“Personality disorder patients, who shouldn't really be admitted in first place, certainly not for long periods of time. And then, by the time they've been in hospital for long periods of time, they’re so risky to themselves, and so de-skilled, institutionalised…that nowhere else will take them. But, you can't discharge them somewhere independent because they can't cope anymore.”* —Consultant 1 *“…then immediately that individual becomes in the sick role, and they relinquish all responsibility for managing their mental illness, and actually within as a social work team tasked with finding this individual suitable accommodation, and the tooing and throwing, and the lack of family support it's never ending..”* —Social worker 6 
 | **Challenging behaviour, emotion regulation difficulties, ASD**	*“…challenge for us, is when we're presented with those challenging behaviours, and they’re always the ones that there are arguments about…complaints from families about…And it's usually because the clinicians will all say its “all right”, but the outside world can't make sense of “how on earth you can discharge somebody who's constantly trying to harm themselves”.. Well that’s cause we cant treat it in this setting, you make them worse, basically”* —Consultant 2 |

The care-coordinator don't have the skills nor the knowledge of the system to say... It's a highly specialist role and unless somebody is delivering on that, then you get amateurs doing it slowly and badly..."* —Consultant 4 |  **Space for supervision & teaching**	“I suppose a level of good supervisions is important. To be perfectly honest, whilst speaking now.. there wasn't anybody else to do it.” — Social worker 1, “The first set of tools is having some effective clinical training and being trained adequately to do the job…. Secondly, to provide space for people to think about their decisions, and thirdly, to support people in making those decisions” — Consultant 1”
 | **Lack of continuity of care** *“…for instance.. it's about us having locum CPN's who rotate often they cannot develop a relationship with patients.. I have a patient now who lost their second care coordinator, which is probably one of the factors that led to their collapse.”* —Consultant 8 | **Continuity of care - trusting patient relationships** “Yeah. I think that continuity is crucial. I would travel 1.5 hour to see them, and they wouldn't talk to me. So I’d be there for 10-15 mins, get a bit of a handover from staff and then drive back home…but that was probably necessary, because she remembers those appointments…That has been the foundation for us to work together to get to the point where we're discharging her to home.” —Social worker 6 “And also, I think, historically, care coordinators thought “Oh brilliant, there are on [WARD NAME], I don't need to worry about them for a couple of years”, because they're going to be there for ages. Whereas now the messages, you need to be involved all the way long, and we're proactively thinking about their discharge from the moment they get to us really..” “…But when senior social workers get involved, and there are housing options available, things can move very quickly, you feel the difference…”—Participant 3 “…the care coordination is key, because some patients, you know, when you see who they're allocated, you're really pleased ,you think, “Oh brilliant, this is going to go well, they're going to be proactive, we're going to work together, they're going to be on the case”. And then there's other people, you think ”Oh, this is going to be..”, and it's not trying to be personal. It's just some people's skill set is not there."

But we've now got a ward social worker who works really hard…”* —Participant 2 *“I think also, social workers who are usually involved in this task. They have a very big caseload.

And then there's other people, you think ”Oh, this is going to be..”, and it's not trying to be personal. It's just some people's skill set is not there. **Allocate one designated proactive care-coordinator (hands confident, proactive, challenging)** “I'll be linking in, I'll be challenging the decision if I think it needs to be challenged. If not… I would say “that’s a fair cuppa, we will look somewhere else.” I think it needs that proactive kind of work…” —Social worker 4 “….because they rejected the person. So I was.. “hang on a minute, why have you rejected him? Can we look at this and address it before you send out your rejection letter? Okay, when we look at this, because some of this information is incorrect…” —Social worker 4 
 | **Lack of placements, housing, declined referrals (rehab, placement, accommodation)** *“You get a string of declined referrals from rehab units or specialist accommodations etc. Which are… you know, third party. But we can't find anywhere to take the patients, so we have to keep them...”* —Consultant 2 *“That’s parts of the issue... where they're referred to commissioned housing and turned away because they're saying they "can't meet their needs, because they’re too complex"* —Social worker 4 |  **Flexible placement relationships** “I think what tends to happen is... housing provider say's "no, there's just lots of thresholds that needs to be met for us to accept them", but what they're actually saying, "we can't meet their needs". But there still is these pressures for them to take them and they're kind of pushed into the corner. So I think there needs to be more collaborative working.."—Social worker 5 “Well, I've built up a good relationship with the housing providers over many months, they are flexible they understand the challenges, and that relationship has really improved over the past year, they are really willing to sit down and relook at things…”— Social worker 6
 | **Delayed or inadequate community treatment** *“You have the option of using the crisis resolution and home treatment services as “a bridge”, which is occasionally clinically a good solution, but often a very poor solution, because this is a short-term team, with changing staff, no overall care plan or resources...”* —Consultant 2
