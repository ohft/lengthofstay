# Barriers
----------------------

| Key themes and illustrative quotes | 
 | --- |
 | **Staffing needs and quality of care (agency staff/competent staff)** “…I mean writing a protocol, a “red2green” schedule, doing the reviews, or building an entire system - that’s all right. But, if you haven’t got enough staff with the skill set to deliver it, then no matter how good I am operationalising it, the rest of it is just never going to work....” — Consultant 1
“They say “Oh, get the care coordinator to do it”. The care-coordinator don't have the skills nor the knowledge of the system to say... It's a highly specialist role and unless somebody is delivering on that, then you get amateurs doing it slowly and badly..."—Consultant 4 | **Lack of continuity of care** “…for instance.. it's about us having locum CPN's who rotate often they cannot develop a relationship with patients.. I have a patient now who lost their second care coordinator, which is probably one of the factors that led to their collapse.” —Consultant 8 |
