# Barriers
----------------------

 | Lack of resources & Teamwork and liaison between roles and services |
 | --- |
 | **Staffing needs and quality of care (agency staff/competent staff)** *“…I mean writing a protocol, a “red2green” schedule, doing the reviews, or building an entire system - that’s all right. But, if you haven’t got enough staff with the skill set to deliver it, then no matter how good I am operationalising it, the rest of it is just never going to work....”* — Consultant 1 *“They say “Oh, get the care coordinator to do it”. The care-coordinator don't have the skills nor the knowledge of the system to say... It's a highly specialist role and unless somebody is delivering on that, then you get amateurs doing it slowly and badly..."* —Consultant 4 |
 | **Lack of continuity of care** *“…for instance.. it's about us having locum CPN's who rotate often they cannot develop a relationship with patients.. I have a patient now who lost their second care coordinator, which is probably one of the factors that led to their collapse.”* —Consultant 8 |
 | **Wards missing designated social worker coordinating transfers** *"We went through a year without a social worker, which is just awful, with people cross covering. But we've now got a ward social worker who works really hard…”* —Participant 2 *“I think also, social workers who are usually involved in this task. They have a very big caseload. Sometimes we don't have social workers. At the moment we don't have one. And we haven’t for a while..”* — Consultant 5 | 
 | **Lack of placements, housing, declined referrals (rehab, placement, accommodation)** *“You get a string of declined referrals from rehab units or specialist accommodations etc. Which are… you know, third party. But we can't find anywhere to take the patients, so we have to keep them...”* —Consultant 2 *“That’s parts of the issue... where they're referred to commissioned housing and turned away because they're saying they "can't meet their needs, because they’re too complex"* —Social worker 4 | 
 | **Delayed or inadequate community treatment** *“You have the option of using the crisis resolution and home treatment services as “a bridge”, which is occasionally clinically a good solution, but often a very poor solution, because this is a short-term team, with changing staff, no overall care plan or resources...”* —Consultant 2 
 | **Need placement database or better brokerage systems** *“When the local response has been inappropriate... literally, the social workers will just have to Google it to find those Rehab places and making referrals… just from what they find on the internet.”* — Consultant 2 
 | **Social worker demands & assessment backlogs** *“…any delay in the last six months, it's largely been waiting for better lives assessments… being processed, and then funding agreed for either supported living or a care package. I think the social workers are quite overloaded with all these assessments...”* —Consultant 4 
 | **Monitoring & screening into the void without outcomes** *“I think our DTOCs patients have been stuck on the ward, with full knowledge of everyone involved, and no amounts of monitoring that… will solve the problem.. You don't really need stopwatch on that, as long as you have some active MDT monitoring, weekly or fortnightly meeting where you talk about how close people are to step down towards discharging, then that’s fine. It’s a problem of doing something about them…without having 20 meetings to talk about that you don’t know where they are going to be put….”* —Consultant 2 | 

 | Treatment and discharge planning |
 | --- |
 | **Shared anxiety between community and wards “not safe to discharge”** *“Because sometimes the people that get delayed get unrecognisably better while they wait. So, I'm a little bit... my line of “do they need to be in hospital or not?” I feel morally must be determined by "Well, what else is there for them?”* … —consultant 6 *“…lots of anxiety around discharge because of either escalation of violence or drug use, or whatever else it might be. It's also the issue of people being held because being refused housing as well, that's another big one.  the community team and its consultant, but also the ward did share that anxiety.* — Social worker 2 *“….I suppose if you've got nervous community workers, and they feel that this person is not ready for discharge, and thinking it's going to increase my caseload more, and worried how we can manage it in the community..”* — Social worker 3
 | **Overloaded, lack of responsibility	Nobody wants to assess capacity.** *"So, it gets bounced about…we have arguments to and from who's going to do this capacity assessment. It delays it being done, then eventually it's done. But it could take up to 4-5 weeks sometimes... as we sometimes think when the case is complex a clinician should be doing it, because we're going to stand up in the court protection...”* — Social worker 5
 | **Miscommunication**	*“….That’s a really hard one. Because it's, it's not great. It's not great. We do have these joint emails. But like I say that has failed….”* — Social worker 5
 | **Easier access of information**	*“So the chap over here, has about 1032 documents on his care notes!? And they’ve lived most of their life in other people's hospitals elsewhere in England, and as many of them have. So I think there's something about accessing the information we need to make swift decisions, that's about carenotes, and it's about an absence of pharmacist input…”*  | 

 | Perceptions and attitudes |
 | --- |
 | **Split between clinical and social work** *“…there's a real conflict for us social workers working within a medical model, we could argue in lots of cases that the Mental Health Act is being used inappropriately to address people's social issues, as opposed to the mental health diagnosis....”* —Social worker 5 *“what I'm saying is the clinical staff on the unit is in agreement. And the cases where there's been a debate …it's been with the social work side of the trust. I’m not even sure sometimes if they should step in, but they do, we can be put under massive pressure. We already know we need to get people out.”* —Consultant 6 *“Interestingly, people very rarely mark people as "Red" they very rarely consider somebody doesn't need to be in hospital, no matter how long their length of stay. The “barriers” column became a bit of a “social work to do list”. So it was interesting that the barrier never really sat with the rest of the clinical team… it became very much this is what the social workers need to do….”* —Participant 3 
 | **“Siloed thinking” – lack of understanding Fluidity blocked – knock on effects	“....a need for greater understanding, not this siloed thinking.** *"So if you delay taking on this patient, who could be referred to your service, and you're doing it to protect your service, rather than fitting it in with an overall greater organisational need …you know, we're all NHS employees. And you should be working for the greater good, whereas some people seem to still think it's their five to fiefdom to do this… Now in some of these cases fluidity gets blocked. You have to go for a hike is power game, you have to be able to say, “if you don't do this”, “I don't do this…”* —Consultant 3 
 | **Feeling, powerless and hopeless - exhausted all options** *“...you can feel relatively powerless as a consultant in all of this.. because if you've got a patient that needs secure supported accommodation. And you know…I don't have a long list of those places, nor is it my job to find one. What am I going to do about it? And social workers tell me that they have exhausted a list of all options. Well… what do I do about that?”* —Consultant 2 *“…working on cases, you encountered the barriers, but you don't really have time or the power to do much about it, apart from thinking about how you might work differently on a case next time to see whether you can circumvent some barriers…”* —Social worker 4 | 
 
 | Patient characteristics |
 | --- |
 | **Deprivation, housing, lack of family support, language barriers** *“…people are better treated at home with their own people. A lot of my patients have no family, no friends, or an elderly parent that can't begin to do it, or a sister somewhere… you could have somebody at home that's quite ill, if there is day-care and if they can access the psychotherapy and somewhere for them to go... Because for some of my patients, they’re so lonely and they’re left alone literally with the voices.”* —Consultant 6 
 | **Psychosis + drug use**	*“The most common ones, I think, are the chronically psychotic patient who can't be placed anywhere because of their risk”* —Consultant 1 *“And then there are people on the other end of that spectrum, who may or may not have a psychotic illness, or probably have had, but have a bit of poly substance misuse thrown in and criminality, and they have lost all of their housing rights. And then they’re trying to get anyone to agree housing is near end of impossible.”*—Consultant 2 
 | **Patients de-skilled, dependency, “revolving door”, personality disorder** *“Personality disorder patients, who shouldn't really be admitted in first place, certainly not for long periods of time. And then, by the time they've been in hospital for long periods of time, they’re so risky to themselves, and so de-skilled, institutionalised…that nowhere else will take them. But, you can't discharge them somewhere independent because they can't cope anymore.”* —Consultant 1 *“…then immediately that individual becomes in the sick role, and they relinquish all responsibility for managing their mental illness, and actually within as a social work team tasked with finding this individual suitable accommodation, and the tooing and throwing, and the lack of family support it's never ending..”* —Social worker 6 
 | **Challenging behaviour, emotion regulation difficulties, ASD**	*“…challenge for us, is when we're presented with those challenging behaviours, and they’re always the ones that there are arguments about…complaints from families about…And it's usually because the clinicians will all say its “all right”, but the outside world can't make sense of “how on earth you can discharge somebody who's constantly trying to harm themselves”.. Well that’s cause we cant treat it in this setting, you make them worse, basically”* —Consultant 2 | 


# Facilitators
----------------------

 | Staffing needs and quality of care (agency staff/competent staff) | 
 | --- | 
 | **Space for supervision & teaching**	“I suppose a level of good supervisions is important. To be perfectly honest, whilst speaking now.. there wasn't anybody else to do it.” — Social worker 1, “The first set of tools is having some effective clinical training and being trained adequately to do the job…. Secondly, to provide space for people to think about their decisions, and thirdly, to support people in making those decisions” — Consultant 1”
 | **Continuity of care - trusting patient relationships** “Yeah. I think that continuity is crucial. I would travel 1.5 hour to see them, and they wouldn't talk to me. So I’d be there for 10-15 mins, get a bit of a handover from staff and then drive back home…but that was probably necessary, because she remembers those appointments…That has been the foundation for us to work together to get to the point where we're discharging her to home.” —Social worker 6 “And also, I think, historically, care coordinators thought “Oh brilliant, there are on [WARD NAME], I don't need to worry about them for a couple of years”, because they're going to be there for ages. Whereas now the messages, you need to be involved all the way long, and we're proactively thinking about their discharge from the moment they get to us really..” “…But when senior social workers get involved, and there are housing options available, things can move very quickly, you feel the difference…”—Participant 3 “…the care coordination is key, because some patients, you know, when you see who they're allocated, you're really pleased ,you think, “Oh brilliant, this is going to go well, they're going to be proactive, we're going to work together, they're going to be on the case”. And then there's other people, you think ”Oh, this is going to be..”, and it's not trying to be personal. It's just some people's skill set is not there." “…But when senior social workers get involved, and there are housing options available, things can move very quickly, you feel the difference…”—Participant 3 “…the care coordination is key, because some patients, you know, when you see who they're allocated, you're really pleased ,you think, “Oh brilliant, this is going to go well, they're going to be proactive, we're going to work together, they're going to be on the case”. And then there's other people, you think ”Oh, this is going to be..”, and it's not trying to be personal. It's just some people's skill set is not there.
 | **Allocate one designated proactive care-coordinator (hands confident, proactive, challenging)** “I'll be linking in, I'll be challenging the decision if I think it needs to be challenged. If not… I would say “that’s a fair cuppa, we will look somewhere else.” I think it needs that proactive kind of work…” —Social worker 4 “….because they rejected the person. So I was.. “hang on a minute, why have you rejected him? Can we look at this and address it before you send out your rejection letter? Okay, when we look at this, because some of this information is incorrect…” —Social worker 4
 | **Flexible placement relationships** “I think what tends to happen is... housing provider say's "no, there's just lots of thresholds that needs to be met for us to accept them", but what they're actually saying, "we can't meet their needs". But there still is these pressures for them to take them and they're kind of pushed into the corner. So I think there needs to be more collaborative working.."—Social worker 5 “Well, I've built up a good relationship with the housing providers over many months, they are flexible they understand the challenges, and that relationship has really improved over the past year, they are really willing to sit down and relook at things…”— Social worker 6
 | **Integrated rehabilitation unit working with acute unit & transitional or maintained housing** “I think what tends to happen is... housing provider say's "no, there's just lots of thresholds that needs to be met for us to accept them", but what they're actually saying, "we can't meet their needs". But there still is these pressures for them to take them and they're kind of pushed into the corner. So I think there needs to be more collaborative working.."—Social worker 5 “Well, I've built up a good relationship with the housing providers over many months, they are flexible they understand the challenges, and that relationship has really improved over the past year, they are really willing to sit down and relook at things…”— Social worker 6 “The reason we were able to take Oxford overflow was the brilliant service we got from the Rehab unit. So, they actively took, or came looking for people who were not acutely unwell but needed sorting out for discharge …” —Consultant 6 “….we need services that are more robust in working with people to help them maintain tenancies rather than going in and out of services. I know there's been piloted a housing first mode, and I'm really excited about to see how that work.” —Social worker 6
 | **Placement database or better brokerage systems** *“We need a more structured resource for finding placements, a database, or intelligence system that helps us put our patients into the appropriate Rehab services.” — Consultant 2 “...like I said, we haven't got any brokerage… there's no easy way to access the community of beds…. So that delays finding the appropriate accommodation”* — Social worker 5
 | **Recognising discharge barriers to prioritise** “it's about identifying the barriers straightaway. As soon as that person has come in, making contact, checking “where did you live before you came in? Are you homeless?” as a recent example… the day that they were admitted, I found out that the family were trying to give up their tenancy to make them yet again homeless. But because I've noticed it quite quickly, we managed to put to that on halt.”—Social worker 2
 | **Active monitoring & predicting estimated discharge dates**	“I think there is a place for working out or projecting how somebody is going to be, because very often is that “they’re back again, and they’ve done what they did four times previously, they’re going to be in…”—Consultant 2 “Using this tracking… we've massively reduced our length of stay, we hit our target early, we're below the national average now for length of stay. It really focused us a lot, and we have a weekly meeting where we go through every patient in detail with the social workers…”—Consultant 6 “…you can have all sorts of clever electronic wizardry to help you…But for me, it's about people continuing to ask the question, “why am I different? Why am I an outlier?” Why when we admit from exactly the same catchment area, why do I have twice as long the length of stay or whatever it might be. It varies all the time. And is about having that ongoing professional curiosity...”—Consultant 1
 
 | Treatment and discharge planning | 
 | --- | 
 | **Gate keeping & clear deliverables at admission**	“The community gets tired and exhausted and worried about risk, and patients are presenting to every bit of the system, and the whole world say “they’ve got to be admitted!”. It's very hard for one alone inpatient team to say “no”, and then to say after three or seven days, “no, they need to be discharged now…. So, a set of expectations at admission, and clarity as to what needs to be achieved for that person to be ready for discharge. The people pushing the patient in at that point should be saying.. “why they're coming in and what needs to be achieved for them to be able to be supported in the community?” we need to be pragmatic, let's move onto to something that is deliverable...“—Consultant 1
 | **Shared goals understanding & multiagency meetings** *“…We set up a meeting with everybody involved including the community consultant and the ward consultant, and we said "this is an ongoing risk, we can't keep them admitted forever. However, we need to try and mitigate that risk [tried stabbing another resident] and how can we can manage it… So we it was more that we worked together…”. — Social worker 2 “...I did a lot of work with the inpatient team, also the community consultant to try and pull together an agreement about the risk and a shared understanding of the risks, and agreement that its justifiable to do this positive risk taking and discharged home rather than to a high support setting.”* — Social worker 4
 | **Family involvement from the start** *““I suppose the carers support and support for families is really important, because some of our patients do either go back and live on their own with quite a bit of family support, or they go back to a family home. Yeah, so that's important. So psychoeducation, and also support”* —Consultant 6
 | **Assigning responsibility**	*“…the things is that we have accountability… So yeah, we are just identifying “This is what needs doing, has it been done? has it been completed? If it hasn't been completed, then, when is it going to be completed and who is going to complete it? And just making people accountable for duties and roles...” —Modern matron 3 “I think there needs to be an identified person to take the lead and ensure things have been happening, and which means doesn't people just assume the wards doing this, and community are doing that.”*  — Social worker 5
 | **Regular check ins meetings** “Yeah, I mean, the handovers in the mornings are really helpful… And then every week we have an inpatient social work meeting where we look at specifically the social care barriers, and then we raise it and flag it if there's any potential..” —Inpatient social worker 6
 | **Easier access of information** “….we do not have a medication "History tab", you must go through unbelievable numbers of notes..” —Consultant 6 “Yeah, the little things like knowing who to contact details not having to actually search or what's the phone number for this? Or who do I need to speak to, who's the unit manager, who's working today who, you know..” —Social worker 5


 | Barriers | Facilitors | 
 | --- | --- |
 | **Mutual trust and leeway**	“...So I think working in a respectful way with the units acknowledging the stresses they are under the difficulties that they face, then hopefully them understanding that I'm doing my very best to find solutions for the discharge and work with me in facilitating that process, rather than a sort of blinkered "she's well enough to leave now, what are you doing about it?!" which might be the case if they don't have trust that I'm doing what I can to make things happen as quickly as possible.” —Social worker 6
 | **Clinicians and social workers proactively working flexibly – not adhering to strict criteria** “They were a very hands on social worker, very bright, good clinician… The patient didn't have a bed. They'd been sleeping on the sofa without a freezer. They had a broken boiler, and there was mould on the walls…took quite a while to get people to come out and do it all… So instead, the care coordinator went and built their bed for them.” —Consultant 6 “...strengths in Bucks was how proactive the consultants were, but it was based on a huge gap in the in the provision of other professionals. I mean, we were able to do it, but partly because we knew the system very well, but it shouldn't be like that.” —Consultant 2  “..we do this on a one-by-one basis, but if there's people who just don't like their Depo much, and they community is trying to an avoid an admission, we often say “bring them up to the assessment hub, we'll do it!” All the nurses will go down to [Building], because they'll take it from the inpatient nurses that they trust.” —Consultant 6  You have to go for a hike is power game, you have to be able to say, “if you don't do this”, “I don't do this…”* —Consultant 3 
 
 | **Feeling, powerless and hopeless - exhausted all options** *“...you can feel relatively powerless as a consultant in all of this.. because if you've got a patient that needs secure supported accommodation. And you know…I don't have a long list of those places, nor is it my job to find one. What am I going to do about it? And social workers tell me that they have exhausted a list of all options. Well… what do I do about that?”* —Consultant 2 *“…working on cases, you encountered the barriers, but you don't really have time or the power to do much about it, apart from thinking about how you might work differently on a case next time to see whether you can circumvent some barriers…”* —Social worker 4 |
