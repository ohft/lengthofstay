# Barriers
----------------------

 | Lack of resources & Teamwork and liaison between roles and services |
 | --- |
 | **Staffing needs and quality of care (agency staff/competent staff)** “…I mean writing a protocol, a “red2green” schedule, doing the reviews, or building an entire system - that’s all right. But, if you haven’t got enough staff with the skill set to deliver it, then no matter how good I am operationalising it, the rest of it is just never going to work....” — Consultant 1 “They say “Oh, get the care coordinator to do it”. The care-coordinator don't have the skills nor the knowledge of the system to say... It's a highly specialist role and unless somebody is delivering on that, then you get amateurs doing it slowly and badly..."—Consultant 4 |
 | **Lack of continuity of care** “…for instance.. it's about us having locum CPN's who rotate often they cannot develop a relationship with patients.. I have a patient now who lost their second care coordinator, which is probably one of the factors that led to their collapse.” —Consultant 8 |
 | **Wards missing designated social worker coordinating transfers** "We went through a year without a social worker, which is just awful, with people cross covering. But we've now got a ward social worker who works really hard…”—Participant 2 |
 |  “I think also, social workers who are usually involved in this task. They have a very big caseload. Sometimes we don't have social workers. At the moment we don't have one. And we haven’t for a while..” — Consultant 5 | 
 | **Lack of placements, housing, declined referrals (rehab, placement, accommodation)** “You get a string of declined referrals from rehab units or specialist accommodations etc. Which are… you know, third party. But we can't find anywhere to take the patients, so we have to keep them...” —Consultant 2 “That’s parts of the issue... where they're referred to commissioned housing and turned away because they're saying they "can't meet their needs, because they’re too complex" —Social worker 4 | 
 
 
 | **Delayed or inadequate community treatment** “You have the option of using the crisis resolution and home treatment services as “a bridge”, which is occasionally clinically a good solution, but often a very poor solution, because this is a short-term team, with changing staff, no overall care plan or resources...” —Consultant 2 
 | **Need placement database or better brokerage systems** “When the local response has been inappropriate... literally, the social workers will just have to Google it to find those Rehab places and making referrals… just from what they find on the internet.” — Consultant 2 
 | **Social worker demands & assessment backlogs** “…any delay in the last six months, it's largely been waiting for better lives assessments… being processed, and then funding agreed for either supported living or a care package. I think the social workers are quite overloaded with all these assessments...” —Consultant 4 
 | **Monitoring & screening into the void without outcomes** “I think our DTOCs patients have been stuck on the ward, with full knowledge of everyone involved, and no amounts of monitoring that… will solve the problem.. You don't really need stopwatch on that, as long as you have some active MDT monitoring, weekly or fortnightly meeting where you talk about how close people are to step down towards discharging, then that’s fine. It’s a problem of doing something about them…without having 20 meetings to talk about that you don’t know where they are going to be put….”—Consultant 2 |
